##Welcome to WanderSync: A Collaborative Travel Management System Project Review

Our project was an itinerary app that helped people simplify the process of keeping track of all their trips. It had many great features that allowed users to have an incredible experience. For example, users could use the app to plan/organise trips. They can put in the locations of their trip, where they're going, and even calculate their trip length. Furthermore, something very interesting is that users could also add other people to join their trip planning. When multiple people were in teh same group, they could add comments about their project as well.
